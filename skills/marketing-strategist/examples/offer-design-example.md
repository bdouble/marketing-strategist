# Example: Offer Design Mode

## Scenario

User says: "Help me create an offer for my online course teaching freelancers how to get clients"

## Workflow

1. **Mode detected:** Offer Design (trigger: "create an offer")
2. **Expert routing:** Hormozi (Grand Slam Offer + Value Equation) + Deiss (splinter concept)
3. **Reference files loaded:** `references/hormozi.md`, `references/deiss.md`

## Output

### Dream Outcome Statement

"Get 5 paying clients in your first 30 days as a freelancer -- without cold pitching, begging for referrals, or competing on price."

### Value Equation Analysis

| Variable | Current Score | Optimization |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Dream Outcome | 7/10 | Strengthen: "5 paying clients in 30 days" is specific but add average deal size ("at $2,000+ each") |
| Perceived Likelihood | 5/10 | Needs work: Add case studies of freelancers who achieved this. Show "even if you have zero portfolio" |
| Time Delay | 8/10 | Strong: 30-day timeline is fast. Add "first client in 7 days" quick-win module |
| Effort & Sacrifice | 4/10 | Weakest link: Include done-for-you templates (proposal templates, outreach scripts, pricing calculator) |

**Optimized Dream Outcome:** "Get 5 paying clients at $2,000+ each in your first 30 days -- without cold pitching, competing on price, or having a portfolio. Your first client in the first 7 days."

### Pricing Justification

The course pays for itself with a single client at $2,000+. That is a 6.7x return on investment from one client. Five clients (the promise) = a 33x return. The price is designed to remove all rational objections -- the math makes the decision obvious.

### Guarantee Recommendation

**The "5 Clients or Free" Guarantee:**
"Complete all 6 modules, send at least 50 outreach messages using our scripts, and submit 5 proposals using our templates within 30 days. If you don't land at least one paying client, I'll refund 100% of your investment AND give you a free 1:1 strategy session to diagnose what happened."

This is a conditional guarantee that:
- Screens for committed buyers (they must do the work)
- Signals supreme confidence in the system
- The 1:1 session bonus makes refunding feel like winning

### Objection Pre-Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I have no portfolio" | Module 2 builds a portfolio-without-clients system using case studies, spec work, and borrowed credibility |
| "I'm not good at sales" | The outreach scripts and proposal templates are copy-paste. No selling required -- the templates do the selling |
| "What if it doesn't work for my niche?" | The system works for any service-based freelancer. 5 industry-specific proposal templates cover design, writing, development, marketing, and consulting |

### Value Ladder Design (Deiss Splinter)

| Rung | Offer | Price | Purpose |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Lead Magnet | "The $2K Freelance Proposal Template" (1 template from Bonus 2) | Free | Captures email, demonstrates quality |

**Framework applied:** Hormozi Grand Slam Offer (5-step construction) with Deiss Splinter Concept for value ladder design.

**Psychological triggers used:**
- Specific numbers throughout ($2,000+ clients, 30 days, 50 outreach messages) eliminate vagueness
- "Even if you have zero portfolio" removes the biggest prerequisite fear
- Conditional guarantee screens for serious buyers while signaling confidence
- Fast-action bonus creates scarcity without being manipulative

**Next steps:**
- Build the lead magnet (1 proposal template) as the entry point
- Write the tripwire sales page using Brunson's Hook, Story, Offer framework
- Design the email sequence using Schwartz awareness progression (Problem Aware -> Solution Aware -> Product Aware)
