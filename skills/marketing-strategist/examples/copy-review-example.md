# Example: Copy Review Mode

## Scenario

User says: "Review this email and make it more compelling"

**User's email draft:**
```
Subject: Check out our new coaching program

Hi there,

We're excited to announce our new coaching program for entrepreneurs. It covers many topics including strategy, leadership, and growth. Our team has years of experience helping businesses succeed.

If you're interested, visit our website to learn more. We think you'll really enjoy it.

Best regards,
The Team
```

## Workflow

1. **Mode detected:** Copy Review (trigger: "review this")
2. **Expert routing:** Schwartz (awareness matching) + Kennedy (GECC audit) + Hormozi (persuasion rules)
3. **Reference files loaded:** `references/schwartz.md`, `references/kennedy.md`, `references/hormozi.md`

## Output

---

### Scores

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Hook Strength | 2/10 | "Check out our new coaching program" is generic and gives no reason to open |
| Clarity | 3/10 | "Many topics including strategy, leadership, and growth" is vague; no specific outcome |
| Persuasion | 1/10 | No proof, no mechanism, no story, no urgency, no value equation |
| CTA Strength | 2/10 | "Visit our website to learn more" -- no specific action, no reason to act now |

**Overall: 2/10** -- This email violates most direct response fundamentals.

### Awareness Level Diagnosis

The email targets Product Aware prospects (they presumably know about the coaching program) but uses Unaware-level language (generic, educational). **Mismatch.** Product Aware audiences need proof, specific results, and objection handling -- not introductions.

### Framework Violations Identified

**Schwartz violations:**
- Subject line does not match any awareness level formula
- No desire amplification technique applied
- No mass desire channeling (what does the reader already want?)

**Kennedy violations (GECC):**
- No GRAB: headline/subject has no pattern interrupt, no specific claim
- No ENGAGE: body is company-focused ("We're excited") not reader-focused
- No CONVINCE: zero evidence, zero testimonials, zero specifics
- No COMPEL: no deadline, no urgency, no incentive, no guarantee

**Hormozi persuasion rule violations:**
- Rule 1 (Headlines first): subject line is weak and generic
- Rule 2 (Promise + proof): no promise, no proof
- Rule 4 (Give a reason why): no reason why this program exists or why now
- Rule 10 (Clear CTA): CTA is vague ("visit our website")
- Rule 11 (3rd grade reading level): met (no issue here)

### What's Working Well

- Short length (appropriate for email)
- Professional tone
- Clean formatting

### Line-by-Line Improvements

| Original | Problem | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| "Check out our new coaching program" | Generic, no reason to open | Use result-driven subject (see rewrite) |
| "We're excited to announce" | Company-focused, not reader-focused | Lead with what the reader gets |
| "many topics including strategy, leadership, and growth" | Vague, no specific outcome | Name the exact result and timeframe |
| "years of experience" | Unquantified credibility claim | Specific numbers: clients served, results achieved |
| "visit our website to learn more" | Passive CTA, no urgency | Specific action + deadline + reason |
| "We think you'll really enjoy it" | Weak closing, hedging language | Remove entirely or replace with guarantee |

### Rewritten Version

```
Subject: 3 founders doubled revenue in 90 days. Here's their system.

Sarah was stuck at $15K/month for two years.

No matter what she tried -- new offers, new funnels, more content -- nothing moved the needle.

Then she joined the Founder Growth Program and changed one thing: her operating rhythm.

Within 90 days, she hit $34K/month. Consistently.

She's not alone. 47 founders have gone through this program. Average result: 2.3x revenue within the first quarter.

Here's what's inside:

- The 90-Day Growth Sprint (weekly strategy sessions + accountability)
- The Revenue Architecture Framework (the exact system Sarah used)
- Direct access to coaches who've built $10M+ businesses
- The "Stuck at a Plateau" Diagnostic (identifies your specific bottleneck in 15 minutes)

Total value: $8,500
Founding member price: $1,997

This cohort starts March 15. Only 12 spots available (we cap enrollment to maintain coaching quality).

Apply here: [link]

If you complete all 12 weeks and don't see measurable revenue growth, I'll refund every dollar and give you a free 1:1 strategy session.

P.S. The last cohort filled in 6 days. If this resonates, don't wait until Friday.

**Frameworks applied:** Kennedy GECC structure (Grab with proof-driven subject, Engage with Sarah's story, Convince with metrics and value stack, Compel with scarcity and guarantee). Hormozi Value Equation (dream outcome: 2.3x revenue, perceived likelihood: 47 founders, time delay: 90 days, effort: weekly sessions with coaching). Schwartz Product Aware targeting (proof-first approach for audience that knows the category).

**Psychological triggers used:**
- Specific proof in subject line (3 founders, doubled, 90 days) -- Hormozi Rule 2
- Named case study (Sarah) creates identification -- Schwartz technique 3
- Metrics stack (47 founders, 2.3x revenue, $15K to $34K) -- Kennedy specificity
- Scarcity with reason-why (12 spots, coaching quality cap) -- Kennedy urgency
- Guarantee reverses risk -- Kennedy risk reversal
- P.S. with social proof urgency (last cohort filled in 6 days) -- Hormozi Rule 13

**Variations:**
1. Problem Aware version: open with "Still stuck at the same revenue you hit 6 months ago?" instead of the case study
2. Most Aware version: lead directly with the offer and deadline, skip the story
3. Brunson Epiphany Bridge version: longer story arc with Sarah's full journey (wall -> epiphany -> transformation)

**Next content ideas:**
- Write a 3-email mini-sequence (backstory -> wall -> offer) using Brunson's Soap Opera framework
- Create a LinkedIn post version of Sarah's story for social proof content
- Design the landing page copy structure using Hook, Story, Offer
