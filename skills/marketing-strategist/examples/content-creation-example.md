## Output

---

I spent $47,000 on marketing last year and got almost nothing back.

Not because the tactics were wrong.

Because I was solving the wrong problem.

Here's what I mean:

I hired agencies. Ran ads. Posted content. Built funnels.

Every single one of those is a "how" solution.

But I never answered the "who" question first.

Who exactly am I trying to reach?
Where do they already spend their attention?
What specific transformation do they need?
What bait would make them stop scrolling?

The day I got specific about the WHO, everything changed.

My cost per lead dropped from $47 to $11.
My close rate jumped from 8% to 23%.
My content went from 200 views to 4,000+ per post.

Same tactics. Same budget. Different starting point.

3 things I'd tell any entrepreneur struggling with marketing:

1. Define your dream customer with surgical precision (not "small business owners" -- that's everyone)
2. Find where they already congregate and go there first
3. Create one piece of content that solves their #1 micro-problem completely

Most entrepreneurs fail at marketing because they start with tactics instead of targeting.

Fix the WHO before you fix the HOW.

What's the biggest marketing lesson you learned the hard way?

**Framework applied:** Brunson's Epiphany Bridge structure (backstory -> wall -> epiphany -> transformation) combined with his Secret Formula (the "who" question).

**Psychological triggers used:**
- Specific loss number ($47,000) creates empathy and credibility
- Before/after metrics (cost per lead, close rate, views) provide proof
- "Same tactics, same budget, different starting point" reframes the problem away from effort

**Variations:**
1. Hormozi voice version: Lead with "$47,000 wasted on marketing. Here's the $0 fix:" -- shorter, punchier, more contrarian
2. Kennedy voice version: Lead with the 3-step framework as a direct "here's what to do" instruction set
3. Thread adaptation for Twitter/X: Break each lesson into its own tweet with a specific tactic

**Next content ideas:**
- "The 4 questions I ask before spending $1 on marketing" (the Secret Formula expanded)
- "How I cut my cost per lead from $47 to $11 in 30 days" (deep dive on the transformation)
- "Why 'small business owners' is not a target audience" (contrarian take on targeting)
