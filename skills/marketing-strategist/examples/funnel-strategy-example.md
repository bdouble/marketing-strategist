| EVIL | Fear of failure, fear of being exposed, fear of charging too much | Validated by results, confident in value delivered |

**Frameworks applied:** Brunson's 7 Funnel Phases and Perfect Webinar structure, Deiss's CVO (7 steps) and Customer Value Journey (8 stages), Schwartz's awareness level progression for email matching.

**Psychological triggers used:**
- Awareness progression: each funnel stage moves the prospect one awareness level forward
- Big Domino in the webinar creates a single belief that eliminates all objections
- False Belief Pattern addresses the three core objection categories systematically
- Value ladder ascension: each purchase makes the next purchase logical and low-risk

**Next steps:**
- Write the lead magnet content (the 5-question framework)
- Build the landing page copy using Brunson's Hook, Story, Offer
- Script the 7-email Soap Opera Sequence using the Epiphany Bridge
- Outline the webinar using the Perfect Webinar template
