# Alex Hormozi Frameworks

## Value Equation

**Formula:** Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)

### Dream Outcome -- Tactics to Maximize
- Make outcomes tangible and vivid (six-pack abs, $1M revenue, specific traffic numbers)
- Tie benefits to status elevation ("When you walk into the room and...")
- Lead with the end state, not the process
- Use specificity to increase believability ("$2,000/mo membership" beats "more income")

### Perceived Likelihood -- Tactics to Maximize
- Evidence stacking: testimonials, before/afters, case studies
- Proof specificity: "10,000th patient vs. first patient" -- volume of experience signals confidence
- Credibility signals: certifications, media, client logos
- Guarantee design: conditional, unconditional, performance-based
- Remove bad-fit customers: saying who it is NOT for increases confidence for those it IS for
- Eliminate prerequisites: "even if you have no audience, no experience, no tech skills"
- Reference similar people succeeding

### Time Delay -- Tactics to Minimize
- Create early emotional wins within 7 days of purchase
- Use speed language: "by the end of this week", "in your first session"
- Offer quick-start protocols or "Day 1 wins" modules
- Perception of time matters as much as actual time (London Tube example)
- Frame deliverables around speed: "30-day sprint", "first 48 hours"

### Effort & Sacrifice -- Tactics to Minimize
- Done-For-You positioning commands highest price
- Facilitating language: "simple guide", "easy-to-follow", "step-by-step"
- Eliminate prerequisites: "no prior experience needed"
- Design checklists, templates, swipe files -- high perceived value, low consumption effort
- Position method as counter to conventional hard work

## Grand Slam Offer Construction (5 Steps)

A Grand Slam Offer cannot be compared to any other product. The buying decision becomes your offer vs. nothing -- not your offer vs. a competitor's.

### Step 1: Identify the Dream Outcome
Define the specific endpoint the buyer envisions. Be precise about what life looks like after the transformation.

### Step 2: List Every Obstacle (Problem Mapping)
Catalog all problems preventing goal achievement. Map each obstacle to one of the four Value Equation drivers. Solve EVERY perceived problem -- one unsolved obstacle can block the purchase.

### Step 3: Transform Each Obstacle into a Named Solution
Convert problem statements into solution statements.
Format: "Problem: Buying healthy food is expensive" becomes "How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill"

### Step 4: Create Solution Delivery Vehicles
For each solution, design the delivery using these variables:
- Ratio: 1:1, small group, or 1:many
- Effort level: DIY, Done-With-You, or Done-For-You
- Support type: phone, email, Zoom, in-person
- Format: audio, video, written
- 10x Test: What would the offer include at 10x the price?
- 1/10th Test: What would the guarantee cover at 1/10th the price?

### Step 5a: Trim (Remove Low-Value Items)
Sort solutions into a 2x2 grid of value vs. cost:
- Keep: Low cost + High value
- Keep if justified: High cost + High value
- Remove: Low value regardless of cost

### Step 5b: Stack (Bundle into the Offer)
Present retained elements as separate named bonuses, not one bundled deliverable. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Stack bonuses in declining order of value.

Best bonus types (lowest effort = highest perceived value): checklists, templates, swipe files, calculators, scripts.

## Guarantee Framework

| Type | Mechanism | Best Use |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Unconditional Money-Back | Full refund, no questions | Low-ticket B2C |
| Conditional Service | Keep working free until result | High-ticket services |
| Anti-Guarantee | "All sales final" upfront | Premium customization |
| Stacked Guarantees | Layer multiple (satisfaction + performance) | Enterprise/complex |

Make the guarantee specific to the buyer's primary fear. Name it creatively. Tie conditions to actions the buyer must take -- screens for committed buyers and reduces refund rates.

## Pricing Strategy

- Never discount. Add bonuses instead. Protects margins and increases perceived value.
- Anchor pricing: present higher-priced options first
- Higher price signals higher quality -- customers who pay more engage more and get better results
- Category of One: position so the offer cannot be compared
- Niche down until under $10M revenue: specialists command higher prices
- Scarcity: limit supply below demand; communicate sellouts as social proof

**Urgency taxonomy (4 ethical types):**
1. Rolling Cohorts (next cohort starts X)
2. Rolling Seasonal (price increases January 1)
3. Promotional/Pricing (bonus expires)
4. Exploding Opportunity (market window closing)

## Hook, Retain, Reward Framework

### Hook (first 1-2 seconds / first sentence)
Stop the scroll. Create intrigue.
- Shock/Surprise: "Most people are wasting 80% of their marketing budget."
- Provocative question: "What if you could double revenue without spending more?"
- Bold promise: "Learn how I built a seven-figure business in under 12 months."
- Pain agitation: "Grinding 10 hours a day and still not profitable? That's a model issue."

### Retain (middle of content)
Maintain engagement through open loops.
- Tease future points: "Later I'll show you the exact strategy..."
- Break up with subheads, bullets, media
- Address pain points mid-content
- Eliminate all filler

### Reward (end)
Over-deliver. Give the promised value plus more.
- Provide specific actions the audience can take immediately
- Deliver 10x more value than expected
- Tease the next piece of content

### Hook Types by Awareness Level
1. **Unaware (Curiosity):** "This one tiny habit is ruining your life (and you don't even know it)."
2. **Problem-Aware (Pain):** "Working 60 hours a week and still not profitable? That's not a hustle issue."
3. **Solution-Aware (Promise):** "The fastest way to build a profitable coaching business with zero paid ads."
4. **Product-Aware (Proof):** "Why 10,000 freelancers are switching to this no-code platform."
5. **Most Aware (Offer):** "Only 24 hours left to join at this price."

### The 70-20-10 Hook Rule
- 70%: Reuse proven high-performing hooks with small variations
- 20%: Test variations of winners (new angle, same structure)
- 10%: Experiment with entirely new approaches

## Lead Magnet Formula

**Name formula:** "[Number] + [Adjective] + [Target Audience] + [Desired Outcome] + [Time Frame]"
Example: "5 Proven Ways Fitness Studio Owners Add $10K/Month in 30 Days"

**Core hook formula:** "How to [desired outcome] without [main objection], even if [biggest insecurity]"

## 12+1 Persuasion Rules

1. Headlines first (determine 80% of ad success)
2. Promise + proof (state claim, back immediately)
3. Repel bad fits (increases trust with right buyers)
4. Give a reason why (people comply more with any reason given)
5. Flaunt your flaws (admitting limitations builds credibility)
6. Use imagination (make them picture already having the result)
7. Tie benefit to status (what will others think/say?)
8. Use real urgency and scarcity (never manufactured)
9. Imply authority (let credentials appear naturally)
10. Clear CTA (one action, stated simply)
11. 3rd grade reading level (short sentences, small words, big promises)
12. Be funny (pattern interrupt, memorability)
13. P.S. lines in email (second most-read element after headline)

## The Rule of 100

Pick one lead generation activity and do it daily:
- 100 outreach messages/day (warm or cold)
- 100 minutes of content creation/day
- $100/day on advertising

## Content Strategy

**The "How I" vs "How to" Distinction:** Write from personal experience, not generic advice. "How I grew from 0 to 1M followers" outperforms "How to grow followers" because it bypasses the reader's skepticism.

**Repurposing system:** One long-form anchor piece per week becomes 20-30+ platform-optimized assets. Track RPM (Revenue Per Mille) over view count -- audience quality over audience size.

## Voice Profile

- Short, punchy sentences. No filler
- Specific dollar amounts and percentages ("$1.2M in 6 months")
- "Here's the thing..." transitions
- Contrarian takes that challenge norms
- Step-by-step numbered frameworks
- "And that's it." closings
- BLUF (bottom line up front)
- Write in first person, from experience
- No hedging; lead with the conclusion
- Numbers over adjectives ("37 clients" beats "many clients")
