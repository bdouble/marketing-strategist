## Customer Value Optimization (CVO) -- 7 Steps

Systematic approach to building profitable customer acquisition machines. Central principle (from Dan Kennedy): "He or she who is able and willing to spend the most to acquire a customer wins."

### Step 1: Determine Product/Market Fit
Use the Before/After Grid (see below) to clarify how your offer moves customers from an undesirable "Before" state to a desirable "After" state.

### Step 2: Choose a Traffic Source
Master one traffic source before expanding. Options: Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube.

### Step 3: Offer a Lead Magnet
An irresistible bribe giving a specific chunk of value in exchange for contact information. Specificity drives opt-in rates above 50%.

### Step 4: Offer a Tripwire
Super low-ticket offer ($1-$20) that converts leads into paying customers. This fundamentally changes the prospect-to-buyer relationship, even if sold at cost or at a loss. A buyer is psychologically different from a non-buyer.

### Step 5: Offer a Core Product
Sell the flagship product to customers warmed by previous offers. Does not need to be immediately profitable.

### Step 6: Offer a Profit Maximizer
Increase average transaction value through upsells, cross-sells, bundles, or subscriptions immediately after purchase.

### Step 7: Create the Return Path
Build recurring touchpoints through email, content, social media, loyalty programs, and retargeting for repeat transactions.

## Customer Value Journey (CVJ) -- 8 Stages

Based on Desmond Morris's 12 stages of human relationship building. Cannot skip stages without damaging the relationship.

| Stage | Name | What Happens | Analogy |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Aware | Customer becomes aware your brand exists | Catching a glance |
| 2 | Engage | Active interaction with content or offers | Turning a glance into a stare |
| 3 | Subscribe | Prospect grants permission via contact info | Trust threshold crossed |
| 4 | Convert | First purchase (the tripwire) | First date |
| 5 | Excite | Exceptional experience with first transaction | If not happy from coffee, no dinner |
| 6 | Ascend | Customer buys core and higher-value products | Deep relationship |
| 7 | Advocate | Positive reviews and testimonials | Saying nice things unprompted |
| 8 | Promote | Active brand promotion, affiliates, evangelists | Working to grow your business |

**Diagnostic use:** Map where current customers are. If most never reach Stage 5 (Excite), the problem is product delivery, not marketing. If most stall at Stage 6 (Ascend), the problem is the ascension offer.

## Before/After Grid

Used in Step 1 of CVO to clarify exactly how your offer transforms customers.

| Dimension | Before State | After State |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| HAVE | What do they currently have? | What will they have after? |
| FEEL | How do they feel right now? | How will they feel? |
| AVERAGE DAY | What does a typical day look like? | How does their day change? |
| STATUS | How do others perceive them? | How will others perceive them? |
| GOOD vs. EVIL | What do they fear most? What is their worst-case scenario? | What is their best-case outcome? What fear is eliminated? |

Complete the grid for all customer avatars. The After state describes your promise, offer positioning, and copy angles. The Before state provides empathy-building and problem agitation for copy.

## Funnel Stacking and Ascension

Value delivered in progressively increasing increments, each making the next logical step obvious.

### Stacking Order
Free Lead Magnet -> Low-cost Tripwire ($1-$20) -> Core Offer ($97-$997+) -> Profit Maximizer (upsell/bundle) -> Continuity/Subscription (return path)

### Profit Maximizer Types
- Immediate upsell (thank-you page or order confirmation)
- Cross-sell (related product post-purchase)
- Bundle or kit (higher-value version)
- Subscription or continuity program
- Done-for-you services (highest ticket)

### Economics
The tripwire and core offer may break even or lose money on acquisition. The profit maximizer is where net profit lives. If average customer value (including back-end) is $200, you can spend up to $199 to acquire a customer.

Sequence cannot be skipped. Each stage corresponds to a CVJ stage. A new subscriber (Stage 3) should not receive the core offer (Stage 6).

## Traffic Temperature and Segmentation

| Temperature | Who | Entry Point | Content Strategy |
|-------------|-----|------------|-----------------|
| Cold | Never heard of you | Lead magnet or free content | Educational: blog posts, videos, infographics |
| Warm | Identified a need, aware of you | Lead magnet + tripwire | Case studies, testimonials, demos |
| Hot | Ready to buy, trusts you | Core offer or profit maximizer | Direct offers, continuity |

Never send cold traffic directly to a core offer. Build separate funnels for each temperature. Use retargeting to warm up cold traffic.

## Lead Magnet Creation (Splinter Concept)

Product Splintering: break off pieces of the core offer and sell (or give) them separately.

### Splintering Hierarchy
- Core Offer (flagship, high ticket)
- Tripwire splintered from Core Offer (one piece, low price)
- Lead Magnet splintered from Tripwire (one piece of the piece, free)

### Example
- Core: Complete marketing training ($997)
- Tripwire: Facebook Ads module from that program ($7)
- Lead Magnet: Facebook Ad Template Library from that module (free)
