# Gary Vaynerchuk Frameworks

## GaryVee Content Model (Pillar-to-Micro Repurposing)

Turn one pillar piece into 30+ platform-specific micro-content.

### Step 1: Create Pillar Content
Record one long-form piece (60+ minutes): keynote, podcast, Q&A, vlog, or interview. Publish natively on YouTube, podcast feeds, and long-form platforms.

### Step 2: Extract Micro-Content (First Round)
Pull the best moments into:
- Short video clips (15s for Stories; 60-90s for feed; 3-5min standalone)
- Quote images from the most quotable lines
- GIFs of reaction moments or punchy statements
- Audiograms (audio clips with waveform visuals)
- Blog post (transcription, edited for reading)
- Email newsletter excerpt
- 9+ Twitter/X text snippets per pillar piece
- Memes using punchlines
- Instagram/TikTok Story clips
- LinkedIn articles
- Slide decks from keynote points

### Step 3: Distribute (Platform-Specific)
Format each piece for its destination. Distribute across 20+ platforms simultaneously.

### Step 4: Gather Community Insights
Monitor performance. Ask the community: "Which moment hit hardest?" Use engagement signals (comments, shares, saves) to identify what resonated.

### Step 5: Create Second-Round Micro-Content
Best-performing clips get extended treatment. A 30-second clip that performed well becomes a standalone 3-minute video. A high-engagement quote becomes a graphic series.

### Step 6: Distribute Second Round
Same distribution logic, now with higher confidence in the content.

## Document, Don't Create

Stop crafting "perfect" content. Start sharing your real life.

### What to Document
- Daily business operations (meetings, decisions, problem-solving)
- Wins and losses (announce failures as openly as successes)
- Behind-the-scenes moments (pre-stage nerves, post-meeting debriefs)
- Client interactions (with permission)
- Process and craft (how you actually do your work)
- Personal struggles tied to professional growth

### Implementation
- Smartphone is sufficient. Imperfection signals authenticity.
- Capture then filter: record more than you post, select the best
- One documented moment becomes YouTube vlog + TikTok clip + Twitter thread + LinkedIn reflection + Instagram Story

## The $1.80 Strategy

Leave genuine comments on the top 9 posts for 10 relevant hashtags, every day. 9 x 10 x $0.02 = $1.80 of thought deposited daily.

### Process
1. Select 10 hashtags relevant to your niche (mix popular + mid-tier + niche-specific)
2. For each hashtag, open the top 9 posts
3. Research the account before commenting (read bio, understand who they are)
4. Leave a genuine, substantive comment (not "Great post!" -- add perspective, ask a question, tag someone relevant)
5. Repeat daily without exception

### Expected Results
- 90 quality interactions per day
- 3-4 new followers per day from consistent execution
- Deep platform literacy from daily exposure to niche content

## Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook

### Jabs (Value-First Content)
- Lightweight, easy to consume
- About the audience's interests, not yours
- No transaction required
- Native to platform
- Examples: educational posts, entertainment, inspirational stories, behind-the-scenes, free tips, polls/questions

### Right Hooks (Direct Asks)
- Clear CTA: buy, subscribe, sign up, download
- Timed correctly after sufficient jabs
- Still formatted natively for the platform
- Examples: product launches, course enrollments, event tickets

### Key Clarification
Jabs are not deposits you redeem. They build relationship capital that makes the ask non-offensive -- but the audience still decides. Putting out great content does not entitle you to the sale. It just allows you to have the audacity to ask.

## Day Trading Attention (Key Frameworks)

### Underpriced Attention
At any point in time, certain channels offer reach at a cost far lower than the actual value of that reach. Find these channels early and execute well before they become expensive.

Historical examples: Facebook ads 2012-2014, Instagram organic 2014-2016, TikTok organic 2019-2022, LinkedIn organic (still underpriced for B2B).

### TikTokification of Social Media
Platforms moved from social graph (content from people you follow) to interest graph (content the algorithm predicts engagement with, regardless of who made it).

Implications:
- New accounts can reach massive audiences without existing followers
- Content quality matters more than follower count
- "Creative is the variable of success"
- Large follower counts no longer guarantee reach advantage

### The Modern Advertising Framework (CD, PAC, SOC)

**CD -- Cohort Development:** Define audience segments with specificity around subcultures, life stages, affinities, psychographics, cultural identities. Avoid vague targeting.

**PAC -- Platforms and Culture:** Each platform has distinct culture, user psychology, behavioral patterns, and content norms. Master native features and track feature rollouts.

**SOC -- Strategic Organic Content:** Content quality checklist:
- Does it feel authentic, not like advertising?
- Is the hook compelling within 3 seconds?
- Do people watch completely and engage?
- Does it evoke emotion and tell a story?
- Is it native to the platform?

### Amplification (Paid + Organic)
1. Post organically first -- do not spend money initially
2. Monitor which organic posts perform
3. Promote the winners with paid spend
4. Use proven organic success as signal for higher-production commercial content

### Post-Creative Strategy
After creating and posting content, actively engage with every comment. Comments are a second piece of content -- each reply is a chance to add value, build relationship, and increase algorithmic reach. Treat comment sections as their own content channel.

### Modern Commercials
Create 4-6 second "commercials" for social media -- ultra-short branded content designed for the attention spans of feed-based platforms. These are not traditional ads but entertaining, native-feeling micro-content with brand integration.

## Volume vs. Quality

High volume forces rapid iteration. More data = faster learning = faster quality improvement.

**Volume numbers:**
- Minimum: 1-2 posts/day on all major platforms
- Ideal: 6-7 pieces of content/day across all platforms
- For brands: at least 64 pieces/day (team-level)

Creating too much content will not cause fatigue because no consumer sees all of your content. Distribution is algorithmically fragmented.

### Micro Speed, Macro Patience
- **Micro speed:** Execute fast at the content level. Post today. Ship imperfect content.
- **Macro patience:** The brand/business payoff takes years. Do not expect results in 30 days. The compounding effects start at month 18-24.

## Voice Profile

- Authentic, conversational, direct
- "Listen..." and "Look..." openings
- Calls out excuses directly
- Emphasizes patience and volume
- References pop culture and sports analogies
- "You just gotta..." motivational pushes
- Intense energy without being profane in written form
- Repetition of core principles (patience, empathy, volume)
- Never pretends to be anything other than himself
