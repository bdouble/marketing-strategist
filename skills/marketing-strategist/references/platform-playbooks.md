# Platform Playbooks

Platform-specific execution guides with format, tone, hooks, CTAs, and anti-patterns.

## Twitter/X

**Primary voice:** Hormozi
**Format:** Thread (5-12 tweets) or standalone tweet (280 chars)

### Thread Structure
- Tweet 1 (Hook): "I [impressive result] in [timeframe]. Here's the [number]-step system:"
- Tweet 2: "Most people fail because [common mistake]."
- Tweets 3-10: "Step X: [Specific tactic]" (one per tweet, actionable)
- Tweet 11: "The difference between [beginners] and [experts]:"
- Tweet 12: "Repost if this was valuable. Follow for more."

### Hooks That Work
- Bold claim + specific number: "I studied 347 viral posts. Found 1 pattern."
- Contrarian take: "Everyone's building funnels wrong."
- Result + timeline: "I made $1.2M in 6 months with zero followers."
- Curiosity gap: "This one change 10x'd my conversions."

### Transitions
- "Here's how:"
- "Here's why:"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Most people don't realize..."

### CTA Options
- "Repost this if valuable + follow for more"
- "Which one surprised you most?"
- "Bookmark this. You'll need it."
- "Comment [word] and I'll send you the template"

### Anti-Patterns
- Threads longer than 12 tweets (engagement drops)
- Generic advice without numbers
- No hook in tweet 1
- Mixing multiple topics in one thread

## LinkedIn

**Primary voice:** Brunson
**Format:** Personal story -> framework -> soft CTA (1,300-1,500 chars)

### Structure
1. Opening hook (first 2-3 visible lines -- must force "see more" click)
2. Personal struggle or relatable situation
3. The wall hit
4. The breakthrough / epiphany
5. The framework or lesson (3-5 bullets)
6. Vulnerable insight or reflection
7. Soft CTA (question or save prompt)

### Formatting Rules
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Lots of white space between paragraphs
- Line breaks between thoughts
- No hashtags in the body (add 3-5 at the end if desired)
- Emojis sparingly or not at all

### Hooks That Work
- "I almost quit [X] last year. Here's what changed."
- "Nobody tells you this about [topic]..."
- "The worst advice I ever got about [topic]:"
- "3 years ago, I was [relatable struggle]. Today..."
- "I made a mistake that cost me [specific loss]."

### CTA Options
- "What would you add?"
- "Save this for later"
- "Which of these resonates most?"
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this"

### Anti-Patterns
- Starting with "I'm excited to announce..."
- Dense paragraphs (no one reads walls of text)
- Hard selling or link dropping in the post body
- Company page voice instead of personal voice

## Instagram

**Primary voice:** GaryVee
**Formats:** Carousels, Reels, Stories, Feed posts

### Carousels (Highest Engagement)
- Slide 1: Bold title slide with one compelling statement
- Slides 2-9: One idea per slide, large text, minimal design
- Slide 10: Summary + CTA ("Save this" or "Share with someone who needs this")
- Keep text large enough to read without zooming
- Use consistent brand colors/fonts across slides

### Reels
- Hook in first 1 second (text overlay or bold opening statement)
- Value delivery in 15-30 seconds
- Talking head, green screen, or text overlay formats
- Use trending audio when appropriate
- End with CTA: "Follow for more" or "Save this"

### Stories
- Behind-the-scenes, raw documentation
- Polls and question stickers for engagement
- Multiple stories per day (5-10)
- Mix of personal and professional
- Use "Add yours" stickers for participation

### Captions
- Mini-blog post format with line breaks
- Hook in first line
- Value in the middle
- CTA at the end
- 5-10 hashtags (mix popular + niche-specific)

### Anti-Patterns
- Over-polished studio content (reads as advertising)
- Posting only Reels or only carousels (mix formats)
- Ignoring Stories (connection-building tool)
- Using all 30 hashtag slots (looks spammy)

## YouTube

**Primary voice:** Kennedy
**Format:** Long-form (8-15 min standard, 45-90 min deep-dive)

### Title Formula
- Specific outcome + timeline: "How to Get 10,000 Email Subscribers in 90 Days"
- Before/after: "My Business Before vs. After [Strategy]"
- Shocking claim: "Why 90% of [Group] Fail at [Thing]"
- Number list: "7 [Things] That [Result] (Most People Miss #4)"

### Thumbnail
- Before/after visual
- Large text (3-5 words max)
- Expressive face or shocking visual
- High contrast colors
- Must be readable at small size

### Video Structure
1. Hook (0-15s): "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to..."
2. Problem (15s-2min): Agitate the problem
3. Solution overview (2-4min): Present the framework
4. Deep dive (4-12min): Step-by-step execution
5. Proof (throughout): Case studies, results, testimonials
6. CTAs: At 2-3 points throughout + strong end CTA

### CTA Options
- "Subscribe and hit the bell for more"
- "Drop a comment with your biggest takeaway"

- "Watch this next video for the advanced version"

### Anti-Patterns
- Intros longer than 15 seconds
- No timestamps in description
- Missing end screen elements
- Title/thumbnail mismatch (clickbait without delivery)

## Email

**Primary voice:** Schwartz (awareness-matched)
**Format:** Subject line -> body -> CTA -> P.S.

### Subject Line by Awareness Level
- Unaware: Curiosity-driven ("The hidden reason behind [common symptom]")
- Problem Aware: Empathy-driven ("Tired of [specific frustration]?")
- Solution Aware: Mechanism-driven ("The [approach] that actually works for [goal]")
- Product Aware: Proof-driven ("[Number] people are already [achieving result]")
- Most Aware: Offer-driven ("[Product name] -- [offer details]")

### Structure
- First line continues the subject line (no greeting, no "Hi [Name]")
- Story or case study in body (specific, not generic)
- One clear CTA (not multiple competing actions)
- P.S. with bonus value, urgency restatement, or secondary hook

### Length
- Nurture emails: 300-500 words
- Sales emails: 800-1,500 words
- Welcome sequence: 5-7 emails, story-driven (Soap Opera Sequence)
- Ongoing: Daily or 3x/week, personality-driven (Seinfeld Emails)

### Anti-Patterns

- Generic "just checking in" subject lines
- Long emails for most-aware audiences (they just need the offer)
- Short emails for unaware audiences (they need the story first)

### Content Formats

### CTA Options
