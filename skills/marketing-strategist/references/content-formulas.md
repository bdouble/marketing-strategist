Tomorrow, I'll tell you what happened next.

```

## Value Ladder Post (Brunson)

```
Free: [Lead magnet that solves a micro problem]
$[X]: [Tripwire that extends the solution]
$[XX]: [Core offer that creates transformation]
$[XXX]: [Premium that accelerates results]

This is how you build a business that actually scales.

Each rung solves a bigger problem.
Each rung creates more value.
Each rung makes the next one obvious.

Most businesses fail because they offer one thing at one price. Build the ladder.
```

[Reason-why for the deadline -- specific, credible]

- [Consequence 3: next opportunity timing]

Plus, if you join today, you also get:
- [Fast-action bonus 1]
- [Fast-action bonus 2]

```
