## Purple Cow: What Makes Something Remarkable

Remarkable does not mean "better." It means worth making a remark about. In a world of brown cows (ordinary, adequate), a Purple Cow is so extraordinary it is worth noticing and talking about.

### Criteria for Being Remarkable
1. **Innovation:** Move beyond competitor imitation toward novel problem-solving
2. **Risk-Taking:** Accept failure as the price of pursuing remarkability
3. **Early Adopter Focus:** Target enthusiasts most likely to amplify the message
4. **Continuous Evolution:** Maintain remarkability as markets shift; a Purple Cow can fade
5. **Storytelling:** Create narratives people naturally want to share

### Finding the Edges
- Review your marketing and find where the extreme edges are for you and competitors
- Find the edge that makes you most remarkable to the smallest viable group
- Immerse in fan magazines, trade shows, and niche reviews to understand what the target audience obsesses over
- Build a culture of aggressive prototyping: watch, measure, learn, fail, iterate

### Otaku and Sneezers
**Otaku:** Japanese concept describing something more than a hobby and less than an obsession. Find people with otaku for your niche.

**Sneezers:** Key spreading agents of an idea virus. Experts who tell colleagues, friends, and followers about new products on which they are perceived authorities. Sneezers in a niche market are more likely to talk about your product than generalist sneezers.

Find sneezers for a small niche first, then make the remarkable product for that niche.

## Permission Marketing

The privilege (not right) of delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages to people who actually want them.

### Three Criteria (All Must Be True)
1. **Anticipated:** People look forward to hearing from you
2. **Personal:** The message is directly related to the individual
3. **Relevant:** The message is something they are genuinely interested in

### Five Levels of Permission (Bottom to Top)
1. **Situational:** Contact initiated by customer. Transactional, context-specific.
2. **Brand Trust:** Prospect permits continued supply based on established trust.
3. **Personal Relationship:** Permission from personal relationship with someone in the organization.
4. **Purchase on Approval:** Consumer confirms purchases based on previous engagement.
5. **Intravenous:** Highest form. Marketer makes decisions on behalf of consumer without prior consent each time (subscriptions, auto-replenishment).

### Five-Step Permission Marketing Process
1. Offer an incentive to volunteer for inbound messaging
2. Using the attention, provide a curriculum teaching about your products/services
3. Reinforce the incentive to maintain the permission
4. Offer more incentives to gain even more permission
5. Leverage the permission to change behavior and turn it into value

## Smallest Viable Audience

Start with the minimum number of people needed to make your effort worthwhile. Kevin Kelly's concept: 1,000 true fans can sustain an independent creator.

- Find people who will understand you and fall in love with where you hope to take them
- "Loving you is a way of expressing themselves" -- belonging to your movement is an expression of who they are
- The goal is not the largest possible market; it is the group for whom your work is MOST meaningful

## Status Roles (Two Axes)

**Dominion (Vertical):** Who is above/below me? Who is winning or losing? Status measured by power and position.

**Affiliation (Horizontal):** Who is standing next to me? Are we in sync? Status measured by belonging and connection.

Marketing must determine which dimension the audience cares about. Status has inertia (easier to maintain than change) and is beholder-determined (different groups measure it differently).

## Tribes and Leadership

A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea. Three requirements: shared direction, a leader, and connection.

### The Leader's Role
- Challenge the status quo
- Create a culture around the goal
- Provide tools to tighten member connections to each other
- Leverage the tribe to spread the idea further

A leader with a small, committed tribe can move markets. The leader identifies the movement's direction before the tribe does, then helps them get there faster.

## The Dip

### Three Curves
**The Dip:** Long slog between starting and mastery. The difficulty is a feature -- it keeps competitors from succeeding. Push through.

**The Cul-de-Sac:** A dead end. Significant effort produces no improvement. Quit as soon as recognized.

**The Cliff:** You improve until suddenly you fall off. Quit before reaching the cliff.

### When to Quit (Strategic Quitting)
- You are in a Cul-de-Sac or heading toward a Cliff
- No progress despite sustained effort
- Payoff is not worth the dip
- You are quitting reactively in the moment of discomfort (bad quitting)

### When to Stick
- You are in a Dip (temporary difficulty before mastery)
- Making progress, even slowly
- Payoff is worth the struggle
- Becoming best in the world at this is possible and valuable

Outline the quitting strategy BEFORE the discomfort arrives.

## Identity-Based Marketing

"People like us do things like this."

Most people's actions are driven by one question: "Do people like me do things like this?" Marketing's job is to normalize new behaviors and shift culture.

### How It Works
- Show people how your product fits within "what people like us do"
- The act of buying is an expression of who the customer is (or wants to be)
- Match audience beliefs about community, opportunity, luxury, status
- Position to be meaningful to a few and invisible to the rest

### The Simple Marketing Promise
- "My product is for people who believe ___."
- "I will focus on people who want ___."
- "I promise that engaging with what I make will help you get ___."

### Five-Step Marketing Assertion
1. Invent something worth making with a story worth telling
2. Design it for the few who will particularly benefit and care
3. Tell a story matching the built-in narrative of that tiny group
4. Spread the word (rarely the bottleneck)
5. Show up regularly, consistently, and generously for years

## Brand Storytelling and Trust

- Stories are frames through which people interpret facts
- People only buy what they can believe -- stories must be consistent with their worldview
- Trust is built through consistency, frequency, and specificity of signal
- "Evolutionary forces associate trust with frequency" -- showing up repeatedly is not optional
- Send signals specific to your audience; they will trust you more than generic signals

## Voice Profile

- Brief, provocative, philosophical
- Questions more than statements
- "What if..." and "Consider..." openings
- Challenges conventional wisdom gently
- Focus on meaning and belonging
- "People like us do things like this" framing
- Never sells hard; always earns
- Uses analogy and metaphor over data
- Patience-oriented; plays the long game
